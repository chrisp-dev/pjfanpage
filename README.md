# fanpage

### Activity Instructions
```
Open VS Code, create a new file, and then save it as fanpage.html. It's important to have the .html extension so that VS Code knows what type of file it is and knows how to read it.
```
```
Create the structure for your page. Reference the example in Module 8. Be sure to include the !DOCTYPE declaration and the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags where appropriate.
```
